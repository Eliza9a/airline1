# Airline Ticket Sale System

In my second year of university, I developed a user-friendly desktop application 
for an airline's ticket sale system using Java Swing for the GUI, SQL for the database, and GitHub for version 
control.

This project deepened my Java and SQL skills while encouraging collaborative development 
experience. 

There are two reports for the implementation attached for more information.
